This list includes all the projects from [DFINITY Showcase](https://dfinity.org/showcase/) but is a lot more than that. It tries to index all the known IC dApps. Some of those projects have received [developer grants from the DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org/grants/). Some of them may not have been deployed on IC yet - though the expectation is that they are working toward that. All info is obtained from public channels. 

If you find an IC dApp is still missing from this page, please [send a PR to its Github repo](https://github.com/zire/awesome-IC) so that I can merge, or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/herbertyang), or [send me an email](mailto: herbert.yang@dfinity.org?subject=More dApp on Awesome IC). Suggestions on how to make this site more useful to the community are always welcome. Many thanks. 

For those projects with Twitter handles, they can also be found at ["IC Projects - All" list on Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1443165233510436868).
